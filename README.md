## Installation

To set up my development environment, I first created a repository in GitHub to store my code. I then downloaded the clientâ€™s content that needed to be refactored. 

Going over the index.html, I noticed the images needed the [alt] attribute to be added to make the website more accessible for anyone who cannot view the image due to a slow connection or the need for a screen reader.

I next fixed the broken link that should have taken you to the Search Engine Optimization portion of the website. It needed the [class] selector to be updated to the [id] selector to read the style.css sheet correctly and perform the task.

Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing [id] selectors were consolidated to remove excess code from the CSS style sheet. 

## Usage 

This website is set up to be easy to use. Simple pick the topic you are most interested in from the top right corner:

![Header Links](/assets/images/Screenshot%20headers.png)



And it will take you to that section without having to scroll down:

For added convenience, you can also view the entire web page by using the scroll bars with your mouse or touchpad.
